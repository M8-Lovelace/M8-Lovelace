Ever since I joined GitHub **1** years ago, I pushed **421** commits, submitted **2** pull requests, received **37** stars across **16** personal projects.

I mostly learn **Angular** these days. See my _pinned repositories_ below.

Also, here are a few interesting **projects** (written in **TypeScript**, **JavaScript**) that are worth mentioning:

- [TypeScript](https://github.com/M8-Lovelace/Notes/tree/main/TypeScript) - Some notes about TypeScript with some examples.
- [JavaScript](https://github.com/M8-Lovelace/Notes/tree/main/JavaScript) - Topics about JavaScript like array methods, async/await, etc.
- [Java](https://github.com/M8-Lovelace/Java) - This is my Java path!
- [Angular](https://github.com/M8-Lovelace/Angular) - This is my Angular path!
