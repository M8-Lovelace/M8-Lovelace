Ever since I joined GitHub **1** years ago, I pushed **569** commits, submitted **27** pull requests, received **42** stars across **19** personal projects.

I mostly learn **React** these days. See my _pinned repositories_ below.

Also, here are a few interesting **projects** (written in **TypeScript**, **JavaScript**) that are worth mentioning:

- [React](https://github.com/M8-Lovelace/React) - I'm working on this right now!
- [TypeScript](https://github.com/M8-Lovelace/Notes/tree/main/TypeScript) - Some notes about TypeScript with some examples.
- [JavaScript](https://github.com/M8-Lovelace/Notes/tree/main/JavaScript) - Topics about JavaScript like array methods, async/await, etc.
- [Angular](https://github.com/M8-Lovelace/Notes/tree/main/Angular) - Projects than have been built with Angular.
- [Notes](https://github.com/M8-Lovelace/Notes) - These are my notes on some technologies.
