Ever since I joined GitHub **2** years ago, I pushed **1348** commits, submitted **40** pull requests, received **49** stars across **24** personal projects.

I mostly write **JS** these days. See my _pinned repositories_ below.

Also, here are a few interesting **projects** (written in **TypeScript**, **JavaScript**) that are worth mentioning:

- [JavaScript](https://github.com/M8-Lovelace/Notes/tree/main/JavaScript) - Topics about JavaScript like array methods, async/await, etc.
- [TypeScript](https://github.com/M8-Lovelace/Notes/tree/main/TypeScript) - Some notes about TypeScript with some examples.
- [Angular](https://github.com/M8-Lovelace/Notes/tree/main/Angular) - Projects than have been built with Angular.
- [Notes](https://github.com/M8-Lovelace/Notes) - These are my notes on some technologies.
