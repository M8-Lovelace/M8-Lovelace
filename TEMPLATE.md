Ever since I joined GitHub **{{ ACCOUNT_AGE }}** years ago, I pushed **{{ COMMITS }}** commits, submitted **{{ PULL_REQUESTS }}** pull requests, received **{{ STARS }}** stars across **{{ REPOSITORIES }}** personal projects.

I mostly learn **Angular** these days. See my _pinned repositories_ below.

Also, here are a few interesting **projects** (written in **TypeScript**, **JavaScript**) that are worth mentioning:

- [TypeScript](https://github.com/M8-Lovelace/Notes/tree/main/TypeScript) - Some notes about TypeScript with some examples.
- [JavaScript](https://github.com/M8-Lovelace/Notes/tree/main/JavaScript) - Topics about JavaScript like array methods, async/await, etc.
- [Java](https://github.com/M8-Lovelace/Java) - This is my Java path!
- [Angular](https://github.com/M8-Lovelace/Angular) - This is my Angular path!
